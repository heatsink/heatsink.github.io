I've been working on this project since my Freshman year, and it is likely that project development will continue for the majority of my university career. However, I'll stop to declare project success when the golf cart can drive to Woodstock's Pizza and back without supervision. Some of the team members won't settle for Ciao's campus pizza, which is much closer to headquarters. The harder goal is being set because we are confident we can achieve it. Not because our campus food is bad or anything...</p>

                <p align = "LEFT">My current role in the team is a focus on collision detection & navigation. We've got a SICK 2D Lidar mounted on the golf cart, which has the dual purpose of object detection as well as be the basis for many sick puns. Since our SICK Lidar was already pushing the budget with its 'modest' price tag of $5000, it only has a two-dimensional field of view. As it's mounted, it detects objects at an approximate waist level flawlessly, but will scan right over dogs and small children. We have sonar mounts on the bottom of the golf cart to aid in this 'minor' issue, as well as to detect objects in our blind spot as the SICK lidar has a 270 degree field of view. I am currently experimenting with ROS's native navigation stack for proof of concept in addition to giving inspiration for our own in-house navigation stack. The bulk of development for this milestone will take place during Fall of 2016.</p>

                <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedText">Our team uses ROS (Robot Operating System) as a software framework in developing for our golf cart. Consequently, a large majority of our scripts are written in Python as it is the largest client library for ROS. There's also a large client library for C++ and increasing development for Java, so there's been some talk of switching. Since message types are really important to ROS while Python couldn't care less, we feel that it isn't the most ideal relationship. However, it is unlikely that python and ROS will flat out prevent us from doing anything, and at worst it's only an annoyance, we can get used to, it was decided that it wouldn't be worth the migration. Our firmware is written in C, and at the core of our operation is a PCB designed in-house. Bay Area Circuits loves us, so they fabricate our board designs. Since we're poor college students, we love them too. </p>

                    <p align = "LEFT">Ninja Fighter is a top-down action RPG written in Java using Greenfoot. It was a collaborative effort, made with four other members during a course in game design. Ninja Fighter also happens to share the same name with many other ninja games, but this was unintentional. We signed some forms supposedly granting immunity from copyright claims under the presumption that we wouldn't try to make money from the project. These university powers were pretty great, as it allowed us to focus our time on programming game mechanics.</p>

Thanks to the work of many fine artists working at Blizzard, Nexon, and many other game companies. Don't worry, we gave credit through comments in our source code. And again, strictly educational purposes. No profit. In the end, Ninja Fighter ended up looking like a pretty cool ninja game with classic gameplay mechanics with a cheesy storyline. As is tradition.</p>

In the beginning, a lone boy picking berries when "The Darkness" suddenly envelops his village. A mysterious master rescues  the boy, who takes him to his cave to train him to become a ninja. The player experiences this training, and becomes a ninja that fights to save his village from the darkness. (This was the best storyline that the combined effort of five Cal Poly computer and software engineers could come up with. I hope this doesn't our university's reputation).</p>

                <p align = "LEFT">The player follows the master, but he suddenly disappears, never to be seen again. The plot thickens. Despite its flaws, I think Ninja Fighter actually does a relatively decent job of introducing players to gameplay mechanics. We didn't have to implement those lazy chatboxes that tell players to "Press W to move! :D" (this is far too common these days). During the training levels, the boy learns how to use a sword by walking on a sword rack (very realistic). The same mechanic is in place where he walks on a table covered with shurikens to learn how to throw them. Hopefully, players learn that walking on objects do good things. Later, as ninjas, players walk over barrels to replenish their shurikens, apples to regenerate health, and eggs to replenish their power.</p>

I think this game was still worth documenting, as it serves as a reminder of constant improvement in programming practices. And it truly isn't that bad!

                    <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedTextMain">I made this power supply during a basic electronics manufacturing course I took in Winter of 2015. It was the first time I got a first hand exposure of creating hardware. Consequently, I admit to making a few rookie mistakes (some slightly worse than others) along the way, but in the end my project turned out alright! It works great, and I'm confident enough in it to plug it straight into the wall in my apartment. With no power strip and no surge protection. Okay, I lied. When I use it I still use a power strip... Just incase, you know? But it won't trip the breakers and cause a hassle if I don't use a power strip, I'm just being cautious!</p>

                <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedTextMain">It's a dual-variable power supply, so I can adjust my two output voltages independently using potentiometers. These potentiometers are controlled by knobs placed in the front of the case, and the terminal voltages are displayed to the user using two digital meters. Mounting the digital meters with hot glue took me a lot longer than it should have... In the back panel, there's a fuse that sits in between the power input and the internal power supply to protect both the user's and the rest of my power supply components in the case that something might go horribly wrong...</p>
