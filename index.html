                    <p align = "LEFT">The autonomous golf cart is a collaborative and multidisciplinary project within the Cal Poly robotics club. I've been working on this project since my Freshman year, and it is likely that project development will continue for the majority of my university career. Within the team, I focus on collision detection & navigation. A SICK 2D Lidar is mounted on the golf cart, whose primary purpose is to be the focus of various bad puns. The component was already pushing the budget as is, so only a 2D version was purchased for $5,000. Since it's a two-dimensional sensor, it excels in detecting objects at the waist-level it's mounted, but has trouble with odd creatures of inconvenient heights, such as the local turkies. Or small children. To combat this issue, sonar mounts are placed on the bottom of the golf cart to see what the lidar cannot. Collision detection works with reasonable accuracy for various steering angles held, and I am now experimenting with ROS's navigation stack for my proof of concept. Seeing how it functions will also give me a design inspiration for our own in-house navigation stack upon further development. This milestone will begin development during Fall of 2016 and continue well into the Winter quarter.</p>

Additionally, the drive train itself consists merely of a motor running of of three car batteries. Therefore, our project can be considered an autonomous electric vehicle! Classifying it as such makes it sound trendy. The PCB itself is split into modules whose names (and occasionally functions) resemble Greek mythology. The upperclassmen, with their glorious knowledge, typically are the ones involved with board design. Although I have historically been focused on collision detection & navigation, I have been practicing my Eagle skills on the side to add my own module to the board. I plan to add a simple component for tracking battery power and usage (along with the corresponding firmware and small bit of software) to track the battery power and usage within the next year.</p>

                  There's also a large client library for C++ and increasing development for Java, so there's been some talk of switching. Since message types are really important to ROS while Python couldn't care less, we feel that it isn't the most ideal relationship. However, it is unlikely that python and ROS will flat out prevent us from doing anything, and at worst it's only an annoyance, we can get used to, it was decided that it wouldn't be worth the migration.

By itself, the bicycle model works very well for small steering angles but tends to become more inconsistent with larger steering angles. Then, some teams participating in the 2005 DARPA Challenge have pointed out, the model is violated at high velocities where tires slip as they turn. Through testing, we added a calibration to minimize the turning bias for large steering angles. This allowed us to achieve what was necessary for our proof of concept, but we are working on a more accurate model for further development. </p>

It was originally written in Java, and pitted AI against AI without human interaction. The idea was to create different levels of AI difficulty depending on the amount of branches (possible future moves on both sides) it considered for every move. However, we ended up having a lot of trouble with memory. As such, games would played out and outputted to a text file within a minute on two branches of consideration, or 20 hours on three branches of consideration. The AI would often make good moves in the short term and make terrible moves in the grand scheme of things since our code wasn't optimized well enough to consider possibilities far enough into the future. Thus, I began to make a new Chess AI (v2.0).</p>

                    <p align = "LEFT">Ninja Fighter is a top-down action RPG made during a course in game design. It is written in Java using Greenfoot in collaboration with four other computer science and engineering students during my Freshman year. Admittedly, the title of our game wasn't very creative and is quite generic (dozens of other games on the internet are also called "Ninja Fighter." This project is our personalized spin on a Ninja Fighter game!</p>
                    <p align="LEFT">A quick concession: most of the artwork and sound effects we use belongs to various video game companies. The focus of the course and project was toward the software development cycle in game design. Therefore, we signed a form allowing us to use others' artwork and music (as long as we didn't make monetary gain) so we could focus on designing our program rather than drawing sprites for it. Thanks to the artists at game companies such as Blizzard and Nexon, the graphics in this game are on point!</p>

The player experiences this training, and becomes a ninja that fights to save his village from the darkness. This was the best storyline that the combined effort of five Cal Poly computer science and engineering students could come up with. It's a good thing we were barred from selling the game from the get-go. If we tried to sell it on Steam, perhaps two lost video game conoisseurs might purchase it for $0.99. As things are in the game industry, four people who played the game would complain that its storyline was worse than Tetris. As is tradition. </p>

Despite its flaws, I think Ninja Fighter actually does a relatively decent job of introducing players to gameplay mechanics. We didn't have to implement those irritating chatboxes that tell players to "Press W to move! :D" (this is far too common these days). During the training levels, the boy learns how to use a sword by walking on a sword rack (very realistic). The same mechanic is in place where he walks on a table covered with shurikens to learn how to throw them. Hopefully, players learn that walking on objects do good things. Later, as ninjas, players walk over barrels to replenish their shurikens, apples to regenerate health, and eggs to replenish their power.</p>

Ninja Fighter  was really popular with my two 7 and 8 year old cousins. They wouldn't stop asking to play it...</p>
                <p align = "LEFT">Although Ninja Fighter could certainly be improved, I certainly achieved my learning goals for this project. Programming individually has its challenges, but the logistics of coding with others was a whole new beast to get the hang of. I've used Git before, but never in a group setting. This was the project where I was forced to learn how to resolve merge conflicts. They gave me nightmares at the time... I am happy to resolve that I no longer fear Git and its associated nuances.</p>

                    <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedTextMain">I made this power supply during a basic electronics manufacturing course I took in Winter of 2015. The experience was my first large exposure into electronics, and consequently, I admit to making a few rookie mistakes. I definitely learned from these mistakes however, and the power supply still turned out all right in the end! It works great for testing inexpensive electrical components! I'll add some emphasis on the inexpensive...</p>
                    <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedTextMain">The power supply is dual-variable. Both of its output voltages can be adjusted independently by knobs in front of the case which adjust their respective potentiometer. The terminal voltages are displayed in the front of the case through two digital meters. An aside: mounting the meters with hot glue took me a lot longer than it should have... In the back panel, a trusty fuse serves as a line of defense to protect both the internal components and the device supplied in the event of a power surge or some other minor disaster.</p>

                    <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedTextMain">A significant portion of this course was dedicated to taking a pre-made electrical schematic and using DipTrace (I now prefer Eagle) to make an intelligent layout for a good board design. If desired, this could have been sent off directly to a company for fabrication, but since it makes a lot more sense economically to order a single large batch of identical boards, my power supply shares an identical PCB with many other power supplies made at Cal Poly. In short, it's not my own electrical schematic or PCB that contributed to the success of this project, but I did go through the process of making my own PCB board design that would have worked if fabricated. I promise!</p>
                    <p align = "LEFT" class = "bufferedTextMain">Ultimately, this is the project that piqued my interest in board design. While I still maintain a stronger software skillset and intend to continue that same focus, I think it is useful both practically and philosophically as a future engineer to fundamentally understand how my hardware running my software works.</p>
